Troll's Riddle:
Mr. Liar always tells lies.
I asked Mr. Liar, "If I asked you, 'Am I a troll?', would you say 'yes'? "
What did Mr. Liar say?

Explanation:
Mr. Liar thought about the question. If he'd been asked 'Am I a troll?', he would lie and say 'no'.
Since Mr. Liar would not have said 'yes', 'no' is the truthful answer to the main question.
Therefore, he lied and answered "yes".
