# Escape the Maze

This repository hosts the Escape the Maze games I've made. Here are links to play them in your browser:

## For Programmers

### Prerequisites

To run the code without a browser, use a Python 3 interpreter. If you use Python 2, you'll have to put quotes around everything you type in as input.

The game code is always main.py in the folder corresponding to the number of the game. (e.g. folder 1 corresponds to the first game).

### Noteworthy Stuff

The shebang at the top of Python Code is #!/bin/python3 because that is how to tell Trinket (where the game is played online) that the code is Python 3 code. 

The code does **not** comply with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for several reasons. Mostly, it boils down to the fact that some of the code is old and I made it for fun.

## Credits

Thanks to [trinket](https://trinket.io) for making it very convenient to run Python in the browser and to Tony Munroe for creating cowsay.
